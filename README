AXIOMATIC
=========

Overview
--------

  'Axiomatic' creates basic Debian-family live system images.

  To build, simply invoke 'make'. Output files will be arranged in
the staging tree -a directory named 'staging' by default- according to
build configuration.


About
-----

  The top level Makefile contains variables which specify the default
configuration but can be overridden to tailor the build. Key settings
are OS_DISTRIBUTION, OS_SUITE, OS_ARCH, and MEDIA_TYPE. For example,
a Devuan live system for i386 can be built with:

	make OS_DISTRIBUTION=devuan OS_SUITE=daedalus OS_ARCH=i386 MEDIA_TYPE=livesfs

and a Debian ISO with:

	make OS_DISTRIBUTION=debian MEDIA_TYPE=grubiso


  Axiomatic has a baseline requirement of make, with wget and sudo
for downloading and running debootstrap. The live-squashfs and
GrUB ISO builds need squashfs-tools for making filesystems, with
the latter also needing grub-common, grub-pc-bin,
grub-efi-amd64-bin, mtools, and xorriso.
